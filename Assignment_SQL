-- Task 1: Understanding the data in hand
-- A
-- The data available is apparently of a ecommerce company. This being substantiated with the details of product, customer and shipping. 
-- Cust_dimen table consists of the data about customer name, their geographical location, type of customer (corporate, consumer, etc) and customer ID. 
-- market_fact table is the table with most detials and is connected to all the other tables with a common field (not using the term Foreign Key as will be elaborated later). It has information related to order, product, shipping and even the details related to order quantity, profit and margin.
-- orders_dimen table consists of information related to order ID, date and priority.
-- prod_dimen table consists of the classsifies product cetegory into sub category and assigns prod ID to specific product in each sub category
-- shipping_dimen table provides information about which order ID was dispatched on which date, what is its shipping priority and gives its shipping ID
-- Cursory review of the database suggests that there is a lot of information in the database which can be used to analyse and figure out profit, profit margin, shipping cost, sales, discount offered based on products, customer, orders, etc.

-- Table: cust_dimen: Primary Key = cust_id / Foreign Key = None
-- Table: orders_dimen: Primary Key = Ord_id / Foreign Key = Order_ID
-- Table: market_fact: Primary Key = None / Foreign Key = Ord_id, Prod_id, ship_id & cust_id
-- Table: prod_dimen: Primary Key = Prod_id / Foreign Key = None
-- Table: Shipping_dimen: Primary Key = Ship_id / Foreign Key = Order_id
